                  <br />Dear Mishi, To the one who's always showering people
                  with love through small notes and letters, here's some love
                  for you... I love how you live in the moment, how you seize
                  the day, how you don't give a f*ck, how you manage the shit
                  load of stuff in your life. You're fierce and I absolutely
                  love that about you. You're the entire package basically. I'm
                  so sure if I were not as straight as a stick and if Manan and
                  Tej were out of the picture, it would be you and I for the win
                  for sure ;)<br />
                  I love you! And I'm gonna miss you very very very much after
                  we've moved out of McMillan. But don't you worry, we will find
                  time in your schedule and meet for Daaruu and cocktails.<br />
                  Oh I almost forgot why I was typing this message, HAPPY
                  BIRTHDAY!<br />
                  Take this moment to just stand by and reflect on the past one
                  year, the things you've already achieved, the n-number of
                  hurdles you overcame, all the people that helped you, all the
                  moments that you're gonna cherish, all the emotions you felt
                  through this year, all the ups and downs and neutral
                  in-betweens. Reflect on where you want to be in this coming
                  year, which faces do you see by your side, which are the
                  changes you want to see and to what extent.<br />
                  You're one year wiser now! (Hopefully) <br />I love you! Happy
                  birthday once again! ‚ù§Ô∏è <br />Love, <br />Prachi.

                  <br />Dear Mishika,<br />

                  Happy birthday! Today, as we celebrate your special day, I
                  wanted to take a moment to personally send you my warmest
                  wishes and heartfelt greetings. I feel incredibly fortunate to
                  have met someone as remarkable as you, and I am truly grateful
                  for the friendship we share.<br /><br />

                  Your Indian culture shines through in everything you do, and
                  it has been such a privilege to witness and learn from your
                  rich heritage. From the captivating Bollywood movies you've
                  introduced me to, to the delicious traditional dishes you've
                  cooked for me, you've brought a beautiful tapestry of colors
                  and flavors into my life.<br /><br />

                  Beyond your cultural roots, you are also a certified dentist,
                  which is no small achievement. Your dedication and hard work
                  are an inspiration to us all! The way you care for your
                  patients with such compassion and expertise truly sets you
                  apart. Your commitment to making people smile extends beyond
                  the dental chair and into their lives, and for that, I am
                  eternally grateful.<br /><br />

                  But beyond your accomplishments, it is your down-to-earth
                  nature and genuine warmth that have made you such a cherished
                  friend. Your laughter is infectious, and your presence brings
                  joy and positivity to any gathering. You have a unique ability
                  to make everyone around you feel comfortable and valued, and
                  that is a rare gift!<br /><br />

                  Mishika, as you blow out the candles on your birthday cake,
                  know that each flicker represents the light you bring into my
                  life. Thank you for being the kind of friend who is always
                  there to listen, support, and encourage. The memories we've
                  created together, from movie nights filled with laughter and
                  popcorn to exciting adventures, are treasured moments that I
                  hold dear.<br /><br />

                  On this special day, I wish you all the happiness, success,
                  and love that your heart desires. May your journey be filled
                  with laughter, good health, and beautiful smiles, both on your
                  face and those of the people you touch. As you embark on
                  another year of your life, know that I am here cheering you on
                  every step of the way.<br /><br />

                  Happy birthday, dear friend!<br /><br />

                  With love and gratitude,<br />
                  Thea Shaye
